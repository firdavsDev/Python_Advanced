##### Multiprocessing #####

# Q: What is multiprocessing?
# A: Multiprocessing is a package that supports spawning processes using an API similar to the threading module. 
# The multiprocessing package offers both local and remote concurrency, effectively side-stepping the Global Interpreter Lock by using subprocesses instead of threads. 
# Due to this, the multiprocessing module allows the programmer to fully leverage multiple processors on a given machine. It runs on both Unix and Windows.

# Q: What is the difference between threading and multiprocessing?
# A: The multiprocessing module offers both local and remote concurrency, effectively side-stepping the Global Interpreter Lock by using subprocesses instead of threads.

# Example: Multiprocessing with Lock

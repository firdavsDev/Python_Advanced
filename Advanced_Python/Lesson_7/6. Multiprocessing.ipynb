    "## Multiprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "The second most common way to write concurrent programs is with the use of multiprocessing (I'm leaving asyncio aside). It's the oldest concurrency concept, as processes predate threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a multiprocessing program, we'll create multiple processes that will be ran concurrently (and potentially in parallel) **by the operating system**. It's important to stress the fact that when we write multiprocessing code, we're giving full authority to the OS to manage and schedule our processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How can multiprocessing help with the GIL?\n",
    "\n",
    "The main issue with the GIL was to protect **shared data** (low level data like reference counts) between threads. But, what if there's NO shared data at all? If you remember from our OS review before, data is shared only **within the same process**. Different processes DON'T share data. Which means that there's no GIL to worry about.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Then, why not to use multiprocessing all the time?\n",
    "\n",
    "If multiprocessing doesn't suffer from the GIL, why not to use it instead of multithreading? As usual with computers, there's no free lunch. Multiprocessing suffers from 2 major drawbacks:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. Slower, resource heavy\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating new processes is a lot slower than spawning threads. And by spawning new processes, we're duplicating all the information of our processes: share data, file descriptors, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "    <img src=\"img/multiple_process.png\" />\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. Hard to orchestrate\n",
    "\n",
    "As processes don't share data, it's hard to coordinate results and flags between multiple processes. We'll see this in an example later."
